# **Relative Density SMOTE (R-SmoteKClasses)**

## **Overview**  
**Relative Density SMOTE (R-SmoteKClasses)** is an advanced oversampling technique designed for handling **multi-class imbalanced datasets**. Traditional SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples. However, it does not consider the **density distribution** of different classes, which can lead to poor generalization.  

This implementation of **R-SmoteKClasses** aims to improve SMOTE by incorporating **relative density-based sampling** to generate synthetic data while preserving the original class distribution. The algorithm ensures better representation of minority classes while preventing **overfitting**.

## **Features**  
âœ… Handles **multi-class imbalanced datasets**  
âœ… Uses **relative density-based** oversampling  
âœ… Prevents **overfitting** and **mode collapse**  
âœ… Compatible with **Scikit-learn datasets**  
âœ… Provides **data visualization tools**

## **How It Works**  
1. **Identifies class distribution**: The algorithm calculates the distribution of all class labels in the dataset.  
2. **Determines the majority class**: The class with the highest sample count is treated as the **reference class**.  
3. **Generates synthetic samples**: Using **nearest neighbor interpolation**, synthetic samples are generated based on class densities.  
4. **Balances the dataset**: Synthetic samples are added to the minority class until the dataset is balanced.  
5. **Visualizes the data**: The tool includes a visualization function to compare **original vs. resampled datasets**.

# Relative-Density-SMOTE
Relative Density SMOTE (R-Smote) is an advanced oversampling technique designed for handling multi-class imbalanced datasets. Traditional SMOTE generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples. However, it does not consider the density distribution of different classes, which can lead to poor generalization.
